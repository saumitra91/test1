Node modules have not been added to the repository.
Please install node modules for the server by using "npm install" from a terminal inside the server folder.
I have used port 3001.
Please make sure that no other application is listening on port 3001.
Run the server with "node server.js"
For client open index.html using any browser except internet explorer, as fetch API does not work in IE
